Patch for STM8 Standard Peripherals Library v2.2.0
--------------------------------------------------

Just stumbled accross this repository, which is a copy of an old repo of mine. However, in the meantime I have uploaded several updates, which have not been carried over in this repo --> please use the repository https://github.com/gicking/STM8-SPL_SDCC_patch  instead. Thanks.

@Virko: sorry to be so blunt and editing your repo. But seemingly there was no activity since >2 years, and I couldn't find an e-mail adress

Regards,
Georg Icking-Konert
